installing the software
===========================
We need to install prometheus software in our system, but we need to first check that if the file exists in our system or not , if it already exists then it will not download.

wget
===========
by using the wget we download the files from the web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS,AND FTP protocols and retrival through HTTP proxies.

Installing the wget
===================
To check wheather wget is installed or not
rpm -qa|grep wget
Yum install wget -y (for linux or centos)
sudo apt -get install wget (for ubuntu)
============
vim shell_wget.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Downloading the prometheus binaries"
if [ -e /home/ec2-user/prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz];
then
   echo "file is already existing so no need to download"
   tar -zxvf home/ec2-user/prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
else
    echo "binary does not exists in system first we need to download it"
            
wget https://github.com/promethenus/prometheus/release/download/v2.42.0/prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf home/ec2-user/prometheus-2.42.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo "file has been extracted "
fi
