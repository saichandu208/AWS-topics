Route53
============
DNS service in AWS,DNS portnumber is 53.

DNS= keps track of all hostnames and ip address
  it converts ip to host and host to ip

we can purchase the domine in route 53
It is global

===========
DNS is all about records
Hosted zone = container od records
hosted name is same as domine name
============
Two type hosted zone
Public hosted zone :if you want to access through internet go with public hosted zone.
private hosted zone: if you want to access it within vpc  or aws go with private hosted zone
======================================
request flow of dns
===========
R53-->Hosted zone-->Records-->ELB nasty url-->EC2 instances.
===================
When we create the public hosted zone two records will be created
---NS record-- pool of servers (~ 4 servers)
-->soa record-->Admin of hosted zone conntains ip
Na and soa records are automatically created and handled by AWS
=====================
Route 53 is Aws provided service 
we another Private DNS services like GO Daddy
if you purchase domine in go-daddy 

you need to create the hosted zone manually in R53.automatically the ns and soa records  are created.
 
then update aws R53 NS Records in Go-daddy
go daddy says ns record belong to the aws then the request will go to aws 

the only problem of purchasing the domine name in private platform is latency

Because the request are redirected from go daddy to R53 in AWS.

Recommanded to purchase the domine name in R53.
