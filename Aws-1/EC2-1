EC2(Elastic cloud compute)
 
The word compute here means u are requesting aws to provide a compute instance(virtual server) wth combination of ram cpu Disk. 

virtual server--> physical server.

if you use the concept of hypervisor and virtual machine , you can take one physical server and share it among multiple people.

here Elastic is basically means a you can scale that resource in anyway.

================================
Ec2 advantages over physical server

lets say u have purchased the physcial server
and installed hypervisor created the 1000 vms on top of it, now for devops person it will be difficult to manage those servers like timely upgradation, verify if there are any security issues, checking server is up or not.


- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
- Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
- Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.

EC2 instance types
===================
General purpose : General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers,
small databases, development and test environments, and more.
compute optimized :Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory. They excel in workloads that require high-performance processing such as batch processing, 
scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.
storage optimized :Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.
memory optimized:Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases,
real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.
Accelerated computing :Accelerated Computing Instances typically come with one or more types of accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). 
These accelerators offload computationally intensive tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more efficient processing for specific workloads.
